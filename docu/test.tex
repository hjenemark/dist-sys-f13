\section{Test of the system}
\label{sec:testing}
In the following first the key test setup and then the main test objectives is described.

The sensor network is tested in a Linux environment on two laptops running Ubuntu. These two laptops are interconnected with an ethernet cable. For further details on the setup see \ref{subsec:testsetup}.

The testing is done to document that the functionality is as expected and acts as outlined in the project description. To test this, the following steps is executed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A number of instances of the sensor program is started
    \item The user program is started seperately.
    \item Promote one sensor to admin.
\end{enumerate}
This scenario will test that everything works initially and that every part of the software runs. 
After this startup procedure a random non-admin node is stopped and started again to show that it will find the admin node again. Then the admin node is stopped and a new one is promoted, to show that the sensor nodes can switch admin node without userinteraction.

This will show a working system that fulfills the requirements outlined in the project description.
