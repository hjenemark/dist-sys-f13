\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

During a time of this project, a temperature monitoring and data gathering solution was implemented. Solution is designed to work in a distributes monitoring enviroment and to cope with simple failures - like delayed messages or several admin nodes working at the same time. Solution was implemented using a C programming language and a PThreads library for workloads separation. Command line user interface program was also implemented to promote nodes to master state and later to get average temperature readings. Solution was tested on two computers connected by Ethernet connection and each computer running 3 sensor nodes. No deviation from specification was noticed during a testing runs of a system.

\subsection{Responsibilities}
\label{subsec:responsebilities}

Program was written by both students. Data storrage, access, filtering and updating functions were written mostly by Hans-Jakob and network sockets processing was mostly written by Justas. Final report was a joint work of both Hans-Jakob and Justas.
